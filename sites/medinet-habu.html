<p>The excavations done at the city of Medinet Habu have led to significant insight into the construction patterns of temples in the area from the 18th Dynasty through the 9th century. As a worship site for the god Amun and the location of the Temple of Ramses III, significant construction took place <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu. (2014)." href="#" rel="citation">(Ancient 2014)</a>. Then later with the rise of the Graeco-Roman and Coptic periods, construction continued on top of the ruins of the previous temples. Medinet Habu also functioned as a refugee center for striking workers and war refugees <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934) The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications (Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation">(Breasted 1934)</a>. The Service de Conservation des Monuments de l’Egypte, Service des Antiquites, and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago have excavated and reconstructed Medinet Habu back to its original beauty.
			</p>
<p>The first excavations began in 1859 and the final excavations concluded in 1932. These projects were difficult since the excavators did not find their discoveries at Medinet Habu to be of scientific importance. It was not until the University of Chicago took over in 1924 that the site was recognized as important. But after the process of deciphering the inscriptions on the walls and mapping the palace adjoin the Temple of Ramses III, the significance of the site was rightly acknowledged <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J.

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>There are many theories as to the origin of Medinet Habu’s name, but there is no definite knowledge. The locals did not even call the city by its proper name, they referred to it as Djanet. One hypothesis is that the word “Habu” is connected with the word “hbw,” or ibis, which is the sacred bird of Thoth. This conclusion was made because in nearby Qasr el-Aguz there was a small Ptloemaic temple dedicated to Thoth. Another hypothesis is that the word “Habu” is derived from “Hapu” (the architect of Amenophis III). This is believed because the funeral temple of Amenophis, the son of Hapu, is located in close proximity to Medinet Habu. This city is also believed to contain the burial site of the Ogdoad, or the first four divine couples. The “Feast of the Tenth Day” is a ceremony in which the creator god, Amun-Em-Ipet, would occasionally travel from his residence in the Temple of Luxor (also the birthplace of the gods that comprise the Ogdoad) to re-perform funeral rites for his ancestors in Medinet Habu. This was an act of renewing creation <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu. (2014)." href="#" rel="citation"> (Ancient 2014)</a>.
			</p>
<p>It is also thought by many that Medinet Habu is also the place where the god Amun appeared for the first time <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu. (2014)" href="#" rel="citation"> (Ancient 2014)</a>. This belief made Medinet Habu the place of dedicated worship to Amun. During the 18th Dynasty, locals constructed a temple in Amun of Djanet’s honor, most likely on top of the ruins of a previous temple. This construction also inspired Ramses III to construct a temple dedicated to himself. Ramses III’s temple is considered to be the most well preserved temple in all of Thebes <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Sullivan, M. (2001). Medinet Habu: The Mortuary Temple of Ramses III." href="#" rel="citation"> (Sullivan 2001)</a>, with its decorated surfaces amounting to 7,000 square meters <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu. (2014)" href="#" rel="citation"> (Ancient 2014)</a>. This temple was designed more like a fortress, which is unusual. At one point in time, the temple was actually completely surrounded by a mud brick wall 35 feet thick and 60 feet high. This different style of construction most likely stemmed from what Ramses III saw when on military campaigns in Syria <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Sullivan, M. (2001). Medinet Habu: The Mortuary Temple of Ramses III." href="#" rel="citation"> (Sullivan 2001)</a>.
			</p>
<p>On each side of the tower reliefs, by the entrance, are depictions of Ramses III slaying his enemies. More inscriptions on the front towers depict military victories over the Libyans and Asians while reliefs on the south side of the temple depict prisoners being dangled by their hair while being hit with a club. And some more depictions of Ramses III’s displaying his power are in inscriptions of the pharaoh hunting a bull while the other hunters cowered in fear in the bushes-this is on the back of the southern tower of the temple <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Sullivan, M. (2001). Medinet Habu: The Mortuary Temple of Ramses III." href="#" rel="citation"> (Sullivan 2001)</a>.
			</p>
<p>Straight through the entrance of the temple is a large open space in front of the first pylon. This first pylon is 63 meters long with four niches that were once used as flagstaffs. The foundation of the palace of Ramses III, which adjoined the temple on the south side between the first and second pylons, is still intact. The “Window of Appearances” connected the temple and the palace as well in the courtyard in the center of the portico on the south side. Covered colonnades flank each side of the first courtyard. The colonnades on the north side have statues of Ramses III and Osiris in front of them. Beyond the second courtyard, down a wide ramp, lies the portico. And just past the portico is the hypostyle hall. The roof of the hypostyle hall was originally supported by 24 columns, eight of which formed a wide aisle down the middle of the hall. The hall also had three small chambers attached behind it. Of this hall, only the basin still remains today. And later in Medinet Habu’s history, a Christian church was built out of the second courtyard which removed the Osiris figures of the first courtyard. Luckily the reliefs here remained preserved after the construction because they were covered with mud <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Sullivan, M. (2001). Medinet Habu: The Mortuary Temple of Ramses III." href="#" rel="citation"> (Sullivan 2001)</a>.
			</p>
<p>Medinet Habu became the administrative center of western Thebes during the 20th Dynasty. Striking workers and artisans of Deir El-Medina stayed in Medinet Habu waitinf for their demands to be met. And by the end of the 20th Dynasty, as war was raging between the High Priest of Amun of Karnak and the viceroy of Kush, war refugees took shelter in Medinet Habu. Even later in the 25th and 26th Dynasties, the cult of the Divine Adoratrices of Amun celebrated in the city. The whole complex of Medinet habu was expanded during the Graeco-Roman period and its history even continued on between the 1st and the 9th centuries AD. During this time, the Coptic city of Jeme was built on top the ruins of the Temple of Ramses III <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934). The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications(Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation"> (Breasted 1934)</a> and another church was constructed in the Temple of the Ramses III, but this time in the second courtyard <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu.

<p>Excavations of Medinet Habu began in 1859 and, since 1924, studies have been carried out by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, which has published the complete epigraphical and architectural documentation of the Temple of Ramses III <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Ancient Egypt-Medinet Habu.(2014)." href="#" rel="citation">(Ancient 2014)</a>. According to the Oriental Institute, the Temple of Ramses III was one of the most imposing ruins in all of Egypt until about the beginning of the 19th century. Richard Lepsius, the leader of the Prussian expedition, provided the first useful ground plan of the Medinet Habu buildings. His work was useful because he was very careful to depict what he saw and did some excavating to try and explain the interrelationships and the history of the buildings. Pictures left behind by the first European travelers to Medinet Habu show Coptic houses erected among the ruins of the pharaonic period, covering the mound as a whole-this was the city of Jeme. Traces of these houses reveal that they rose 15 meters or more above the pavements of the original temple courts <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934). The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications (Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation">(Breasted 1934)</a>.

<p>Medinet Habu was one of the first ancient sites to be systematically brought to light by the Service de Conservation des Monuments de l’Egypte under Mariette. From April to August 1859, M. Bonnefoy conducted excavation operations there until his sudden death. M. Gabet took over from 1860 to 1863. Lack of funds halted the excavations being done until 1888. A fresh start was made with supervision now under the control of Georges Daressy who carried the excavations on through their completion. Their results are as follows: in 1889 a narrow passage was dug from the Eastern Fortified Gate to the Great Temple. The first court to the Great Temple was cleared and repairs began. In 1891, the second court that contained the Coptic Church was cleared. All architectural pieces of the Coptic church were removed from the temple. From 1892 to 1895 the whole area east of the first pylon was dug down all the way back to the Ramses III level. In 1895 and 1896 the Eastern Fortified Gate and the back of the Great Temple was cleared. Then in 1898 and 1899 the complete exterior of the Great Temple was cleared. Though this team was excavating, they only meant to uncover the stone structures. They were not “excavating” as defined in the present-day scientific sense. When the clearing operations had been completed in 1899, the team considered the work at Medinet Habu to be done. They did not consider the rest of the site to be of any importance, so all the leftover ruins were left for sebakh-diggers to take. The amount of artifacts lost and destroyed is unknown <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.).(1934). The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications (Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation">(Breasted 1934)</a>. 
			</p>
<p>In 1903, natives of Medinet Habu discovered fayence tiles in the form of fettered foreign prisoners in the area that was later recognized as the royal palace. Some of these tiles made their way to antique dealers and were sold to foreign museums. Howard Carter stepped up and located most of the tiles and gave them to the Cairo Museum. The finding of these tiles launched a separate study of the Eastern Fortified Gate in 1909. The tiles helped distinguish were the royal palace was located south of the Great Temple. Traces of the palace walls were located and were found to be mad of perishable mud bricks that could still be recognized on the stone wall of the temple <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934). The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications (Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation">(Breasted 1934)</a>.
			</p>
<p>In 1912, M. Gaston Mapero, the then director of the Service Des Antiquites, asked Theodore M. Davis to undertake an excavation of Medinet Habu to find if there are any more buildings remaining among the rubbish of the Temple of Ramses III. He focuses his efforts on the area which was distinguished as the Palace. His team was able to clear the remains of the brick walls down to the floor level of the former Palace. They did, however, leave the stone doorposts, bases of columns, dais of the throne, and some stone wall slabs untouched. Unfortunately, based on the plans of the Palace itself they could not identify anything. Because excavating brought no ultimate results for this team they also decided that no further gain to science would be made studying Medinet Habu. They then gave all of their findings to the sebakh-diggers. After the Service des Anitquites left Medinet Habu in 1913 the brick walls were wrecked to their foundations. This was the way the Oriental Institute of Chicago found the temple when they began their excavations <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934). The University of Chicago Oriental Institute Publications (Vol. 21). Chicago: The University of Chicago." href="#" rel="citation">(Breasted 1934)</a>.
			</p>
<p>The Oriental Institute first began only studying and publishing the scenes and inscriptions found on and in the Medinet Habu buildings. They have published three folio publications of the Epigraph Expedition, led by Dr. Harold H. Nelson since 1924. Later in 1926 and 1927 they surveyed the rest of the buildings and a new plan of Medinet Habu was started. Excavating could not begin until the Egyptian Service des Antiquites approved it in 1927. The excavating of Medinet Habu was done in six campaigns as follows: the first campaign took place from October 1927 through April 1928. They excavated the area inside of the Great Girdle Wall from its southwest corner to the Palace. The Palace was also excavated and around the Small Temple. The second campaign was from October 1928 through march 1929 in which the area from the Palace to the Eastern Fortified Gate and the well of Nectanebo were excavated. And they started the restoration of the Palace. The third campaign was from 1929 to March 1930 in which the restoration of the Palace was completed and the area north of the Great Temple was excavated. The fourth campaign was from October 1930 through April 1931 and the untouched area of west of the temple was excavated along with the Roman Coptic settlement east of the wall. Presence of nearby temple of Eye and Harmhab were discovered and the Palace in the Ramesseum was also excavated. The fifth campaign took place from October 1931 through March 1932. The Temple of Eye and Harmhab, the western Fortified Gate and some chapels beyond the western gate were cleared. And lastly the sixth campaign was from October 1932 to March 1932 in which all findings were divided, packed and shipped. And the team lastly re-examined the Small Temple and the Temples of Eye and Harmhab. None of these excavations could have been possible without the two to four hundred men and boys that were needed at the sites <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Breasted, J. (Ed.). (1934).

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>Medinet Habu is a very important archaeological site historically because of its significant transformations between the 18th Dynasty and the 9th century. The Temple of Ramses III was one of the most well preserved sites in Thebes, so it gave a very clear look into what the temple looked like when it was first constructed. This preservation has allowed for more accurate understanding of the function of temple and interpretations of the inscriptions. Even though the site has changed a lot over the years, the excavations done at Medinet Habu have provided a greater understanding of how the people lived and how the society functioned thousands of years ago.
