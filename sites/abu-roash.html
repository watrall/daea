					Abu Roash is an interesting site historically and archaeologically speaking, its usage almost exclusively as a mortuary center spanning from the prehistory to the Coptic era. Unfortunately, it is also a site too often forgotten and is at risk of being destroyed (IFAO).

					Abu Roash is about 8 kilometers to the north-west of the Giza plateau (IFAO). It lays in a hot-bed of archaeological activity as it belongs to the ancient royal Memphite necropolis: “Wadi Qaren to the north, the Cairo-Alexandria highway to the west, Wadi el-Hassana to the south and the Nile Valley to the east” (Tristant &amp; Smythe pp. 313).

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p align="justify">
					Dominated by funerary structures, the history of Abu Roash spans from the prehistoric period to the Coptic era. It is perhaps best known for the mortuary complex of Djedefre, a pharaoh from the Fourth Dynasty and son of Khufu. Djedefre’s pyramid, though now almost impossible to recognize as such due to previous and expansive quarrying—which was reported as yet ongoing when Flinders Petrie came to Abu Roash between 1880 and 1882 (Tristant &amp; Smythe pp. 317)—would have stretched 106 meters on the side and stood 67 meters tall (IFAO). It has been in this dismantled state for quite some time; even the earliest commentary notes its ruinous appearance (Chassinat pp. 616). Given its position on a plateau, though, it is easy to picture just how striking the pyramid would have looked, as well as the other mastabas in the area. Situated 1.5 kilometers to the southeast of the pyramid is the F cemetery; the M cemetery is about the same distance to the northeast (Tristant &amp; Smythe pp. 313-4,317).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					Currently, there seem to be issues with security around the site; items have gone missing, and parts of the site have been destroyed or vandalized (Tristant, “Le région memphite” pp. 37-8). Moreover, the expanding urban landscape and limestone quarries are encroaching on the site, putting it in even more peril (IFAO).

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p align="justify">
					Despite the fact that many individuals knew of this site during the nineteenth century, the most that happened were cursorily explorations. It wasn’t until the beginning of the twentieth century that any actual excavations formally began. Between 1842 and 1843, Karl Lepsius briefly visited the site for the purpose of surveying the pyramid (IFAO). Some years later, Flinders Petrie came to Abu Roash and though he too never excavated the site he was able to determine that the pyramid located at the site was from the Fourth Dynasty due to the similarities in the casing and in style (Petrie pp. 56).

</p>
<p align="justify">
					The first person to excavate the site was Émile Chassinat, whose work lasted from December of 1900 to April of 1901. He began by “attacking” the east side of the pyramid where he discovered the name of the individual entombed: Djedefre. Within what he dubbed the “chapel,” Chassinat described everything as being destroyed and lacking dimensional uniformity. In one room, he discovered mutilated statues of the royal children with only one, that of the prince, being intact. As he excavated the necropolis, he cleared a trench in the wall of the courtyard where he found a large, beautifully rendered head of Djedefre. Chassinat considered this to be the most important of all of his findings (Chassinat pp. 616-618).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					A little more than ten years after Chassinat, Pierre Lacau arrived in Abu Roash. Between 1912 and 1913, he reported opening three sites. The first one was near the pyramid: the funerary chapel, the same one Chassinat had cleared. Not only did he manage find a large quantity of pottery, but the walls of the storerooms themselves were remarkably well preserved, the designs clear. This gave Lacau an idea of the sheer perfection of the process of painting the raw (fr. cru) bricks used in construction. The pottery itself was mostly shattered and dated from the Fourth Dynasty. He was pleased to have pottery that was actually used in the temple, but perhaps the most surprising discovery at this site was that of about twenty, seemingly Phoenician lamps. Unusual due to their remote location and their being new to Egypt at this point in time, this provided a new reference point for the dispersion of these lamps (Lacau pp. 518-9).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					Then, to the north, Lacau found a small necropolis with tombs dating to the Third and Fourth Dynasties, both of them displaying two different burial methods. The Third Dynasty funeral chamber is accessible by a staircase, which had reinforced walls and whose entrance was blocked by a slab of limestone. Within the room, the deceased individual was placed in the fetal position inside of a small, wooden coffin. They were placed on their right side with their head to the north and their face to the east. Other than the body, there were also many alabaster and hard stone vases. In contrast, the Fourth Dynasty mastabas were made out of raw (fr. cru) brick with two large, vertical wells connecting the various chambers, which lacked furniture, together. The head pointed north, the bodies of their inhabitants were elongated in coffins that were between 1.8 and 2 meters in length. Lacau found within one mastaba a chapel that had an earthen altar at which one could give offerings (Lacau pp. 519-20).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					The third site uncovered a Second Dynasty necropolis after Lacau began investigating the dismantled remains of a series of Fourth Dynasty mastabas on a nearby hill and found green schist vases characteristic of the Second Dynasty. He found supporting evidence in the style of the wall décor. The tomb itself was well preserved and had furniture within it. Between the outer wall and the main room, there were seven tombs. Their coffins, made of wood and holding bodies in the fetal positon, were set inside of subterranean brick vault angled to the southeast; there were little limestone stele upon which was the deceased’s name. The site boasted a collection of alabaster, schist and breccia vases, illustrating the important role of stone vases, as well as two crystal vases. Beyond that, Lacau found a variety of objects such as ivory lions and metal tools (Lacau pp. 520-21). 
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					To the west of the pyramid in 1913, Pierre Montet began working on an early dynastic cemetery (IFAO) after he’d previously been working with Lacau (Lacau 521). The elite mastabas Montet excavated held not only large amounts of pottery and stone vessels but also items made out of ivory and cooper. Montet attributed the tombs as having been built under the rule of King Den; archaeologists now claim that they’re from the Naqada IIIC2 period. First Dynasty mastaba M07 is one of the best preserved, measuring 30 meters long by 20 meters wide by 1 meter high. Made out of mud brick, it sported mud-plastered walls and paintings. There were little side chambers in which the deceased was possibly buried (Tristant &amp; Smythe pp. 314-20).

</p>
<p align="justify">
					Ferdinand Bisson de la Roque joined the team in 1922 to focus on an Old Kingdom necropolis (IFAO). He excavated the northern grouping of tombs in cemetery “F.” At mastaba F13, he found a table upon which were the names of two King’s Sons, though the analysis of this came later than its discovery (Baud &amp; Moeller pp. 16-18). Unfortunately, it is not easy to find any of their own publications, and though many academic papers reference some of their work it is difficult to find good detail of their results. To exacerbate the situation, much scholarly work remains unpublished (Tristant &amp; Smythe pp. 315), such as Charles Kuentz’ 1931 trial excavations in the southern mastabas of cemetery “F” (Baud &amp; Moeller pp. 16).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					With the Leiden Museum of Antiquities, Adolf Klasens excavated the same cemetery that Montet had from 1957 to 1959. He found four cemeteries ranging from Dynasty 0 to the Second Dynasty, uncovering items such as “imported Syro-Palestinian jugs, providing concrete evidence for trade between Egypt and the Near East during the First Dynasty (Wilkinson pp. 13).” Besides pottery, Wilkinson writes that Klasens also discovered an interesting, early Dynastic object providing insight into religious iconography: a plaque of a cow goddess, perhaps either Hathor or Bat, between the symbols of Min made out of ivory (pp. 13). 
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					Excavations at Abu Roash ceased until the mid-1990s when archaeologists returned to Djedefre’s funerary complex, a campaign which lasted until 2007. Michel Valloggia was at the head of these expeditions. Because of how extensively the site was quarried, archaeologists have had to work hard to recreate the pyramid, but they were able to gain an idea of its structure, relocate the eastern wall and complete some reconstruction. The team didn’t just repair the poorly managed site; they also learned a good deal about Djedefre, whose reign lasted longer than previously thought and added credence to the theory that his pyramid had been completed (IFAO). Built upon a terrace, this pyramid had been encased in Turah limestone, though the bottom boasts granite casing. The chambers within the pyramid, unlike those of his predecessors which went higher within the structure, were more subterranean with his burial chamber installed in a massive pit. The mortuary temple lays 6 meters away to the north, where there are also some workshops and habitations. (Lehner pp. 121-122).
				</p>
<p align="justify">
					In 2001, a project headed by Michel Baud was launched to excavate the Fourth Dynasty necropolis “F” (IFAO). Since the southern portion of the cemetery’s necropolis had never been formally excavated, one of his goals was the map the area; the end result revealed forty mastabas and various other manmade passageways. In 2006, the archaeologists had been heavily focused on mastabas F37, F38, F40 and F48. Their pottery was Fourth Dynasty and similar to pottery found within Djedefre’s tomb; it is likely they were made in the same workshop. Further, the team reevaluated supposedly Old Kingdom bowls, which had been used as a point of reference for dating the site, and found them to be lacking any typical features of their previously determined time. Funerary chapels were L-shaped in design, composed of only one, though many of the mastabas have an external chapel as well; in the northern grouping of tombs, there are two chapels compounded in a similar construction, though this twin-mastaba style ceased being used during the Fourth Dynasty. Intense quarrying, however, has ruined their decorations (Baud &amp; Moeller pp. 16-18).

					Yann Tristant is currently supervising excavations at Abu Roash; his work at the site focuses on the First Dynastic tombs, the M cemetery mastabas, in a continuation of Montet’s work. One of the most significant finds Tristant has made was that of a wooden funerary boat in 2012. Oriented along the northwest/southeast axis, it was discovered just 5 meters to the north of mastaba M06; it measures 6.54 meters long by 1.3 meters wide. The boat was dated to the First Dynasty, specifically during the reign of King Den, making it the oldest preserved boat in Egypt (Tristant pp. 44-6).

<p align="justify">
					Abu Roash offers a unique opportunity to experience a variety of Dynasties across thousands of years, which continues to surprise the world with fascinating discoveries such as the funerary boat just a few years ago. To better understand Ancient Egypt’s past, Egyptian archaeologists and Egyptologists alike would greatly benefit from focusing more on this site because of its long usage. So much of the site remains either unexcavated or inadequately so, and it is our obligation to study this site in full before modern-day forces erase it.
