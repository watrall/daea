<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr/><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p align="justify">In 1884 William Flinders Petrie, with collaborator Ernest Gardner, rediscovered the site of Naucratis near the modern village of Nabira. Excavations were conducted from 1884-1886 on behalf of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. In 1889, David Hogarth was sent by the British School of Athens to continue excavations at Naucratis. Large parts of the city were discovered in these excavations such as houses, workshops, sanctuaries, and a large Egyptian structure named The Great Temenos.</p>
<p align="justify">Americans William Coulson and Albert Leonard Jr started new excavations from 1977-1983 for pottery typology and core drilling research.</p>
<p align="justify">Located in the Nile Delta of Egypt, Naucratis was a Greek trading post established around 650 BC during the reign of Pharaoh Psammetichus I. The classical Greek historian, Herodotus, wrote that the Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis II gave the town of Naucratis to the Greeks in exchange for their work as mercenaries. Naucratis became a gateway for trade between Egypt and the people of the Mediterranean, including items such as pottery and scarabs made in workshops located in the town.(1)</p>
<br/>
<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
<hr/>
<p align="justify">The site of ancient Naucratis is today located near the modern villages of Kom Ge’if, Nebira and El-Neqrash, 16km in direct line west of the Rosetta branch of the Nile, and 15km east of Libyan plain, by the side of which the canal of El-Habir flows. The Egyptians called the site Nokradj, or Per-Meryt, the-House-of-the-Harbor. Located on the way to the old capital city of Memphis south of the Nile Delta’s apex, Naucratis was in all likelihood also once connected, via a canal, with the city of Sais, seat of the Pharaonic court during the 26th dynasty, for which it presumably functioned as its international port.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition it was not far from the important salt and natron sources in the regions of Barnugi and Wadi Natrun, on the likely route of shipment via the river port of Terenouthis, modern Tarrana/Kom Abu Billu, some 65km upstream on the Canopic branch, while its rich agricultural hinterland provided ample opportunity to grow grain for export.(4)</p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr/>
<p align="justify">Through the three major excavation periods done at Naucratis, we have a clearer picture of what the basic layout of the town might have been.</p>
<p align="justify">In the northern part of the site, there were multiple temenos (or religious sanctuaries) for Greek Gods such as the Dioskouroi, Apollo, Hera, and Aphrodite.</p>
<p align="justify">In the northeast area of the site was a large multi-chambered structure that was named the Hellenion by Petrie. This was thought to be the most used sanctuary in Naucratis and contained votive inscriptions for multiple gods, including Herakles, Aphrodite Pandemos, Zeus, Artemis, Poseidon, possibly again Apollo and the Dioskouri, but especially the 'gods of the Hellenes', an important early recognition of a common identity by Greeks from different cities. (3)</p>
<p align="justify">To the north of the town, a cemetery with tombs dating around 4th century BC and some dating to the Archaic and Classical period was discovered.</p>
<p align="justify">A workshop for faience was found south of the temenos of Aphrodite. Other workshops were located in other parts of town, notably the potters' and Ptolemaic coroplasts' workshops at the north-east end.(4)</p>
<img class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" src="http://en.academic.ru/pictures/enwiki/78/Naucratis.jpg" style="float:left; padding-right:35px"/>
<p align="justify">The southern end of the site contained the largest structure of Naucratis, what Petrie named The Great Temenos. What he discovered was a massive mud-bricked structure. The entrance of The Great Temenos was a gateway structure made of low mudbrick enclosure wall, with cartouches of Ptolemy II Philadelphos, giving the gateway structure a date.(5) Large white marble rams were discovered around the porch area of the structure with red granite sphinxes being discovered to the west. Petrie surmised this meant that a great road served as an approach to the Sanctuary. Inside of the gateway stood what once was thought to be a temple to Amun-Ra of Baded, surrounded by temples of associated deities, storage, and cult buildings.(3)</p>
<p align="justify">A small mound to the east of the central site, known as Kom Hadid, revealed a ceramic trash heap.</p>

<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
<hr/>
<p align="justify">In 1884 the pioneer of Egyptian Archaeology, William Flinders Petrie, rediscovered the town of Naucratis near the modern city of Nabira. Petrie worked with a collaborator, Ernest Gardner, on behalf of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. By the time they arrived at the site, a good third of the area had been dug away by the local sebbakhin (or farmers) for the nitrogen rich soil that lay beneath the earth. Petrie thought the best way to counteract the damage being done, as he could not stop them from working, was to pay them market value for any finds they discovered and to hire them on as diggers. This practice was adopted by later archaeologists as well.(3) The early methods used by Petrie cannot be compared to today's methods, as finds bought or found out of context from where they were buried makes it hard to completely verify facts such as dating. After discovering the main structures he listed for Naucratis, Petrie sent fragments of vases and figurines ahead to the British Museum, which were immediately put on display in the First Bronze Room.(3)</p>
<p align="justify">During the second season of excavation in 1886, Petrie was ready to move on from Naucratis. Ernest Gardner was trained to take over the dig to allow Petrie to move on to other sites. Gardner succeeded in locating a cemetery to the north of the site, identifying the sanctuary of Hera, and discovering significant architectural remains and votive offerings in the sanctuaries of the Dioskouroi and particularly of Aphrodite. Gardner discovered what he stated as 150,000 fragments from the sanctuary of Aphrodite, leading him to send them back to England to sort through. Although, in what seemed like a huge amount of rich finds, only 17,000 objects are preserved today from the entire site.(3) During this second season, Gardner found that the walls of the Great Temenos had almost disappeared due to the work of the sebbakhin.(5)</p>
<img class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" src="http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN01191/AN01191830_001_l.jpg" style="float:right;"/>
<p align="justify">Over ten years after Gardner left the site of Naucratis, David George Hogarth came to the site to excavate under the direction of the British School of Athens in 1899. Hogarth noted that the sebbakhin were still digging in the area on a daily basis. Parts of the central hollow of the site was permanently flooded and on its way to becoming a lake.(3) Hogarth continued the practice of paying the sebbakhin for artifacts they found, as well as employing them as diggers. Using trenches, Hogarth discovered in the north-eastern part of the site, enclosure walls and several buildings and chambers with cult functions, in which votive offerings were found naming several gods (such as Apollo, Herakles, Zeus, Aphrodite Pandemos) as well as the 'gods of the Hellenes' making it possible to verify this part of the site as the Hellenion. The sanctuary area was notable also for its rich cache of Greek and Ptolemaic terracotta figurines, which far outstripped, in both number and importance, any such finds made by Petrie and Gardner.(3) By the time Hogarth arrived at the site, the digging from the sebbakhin had completely leveled almost every structure in the area. Hogarth was unable to pinpoint the location of the Great Temenos, causing him to wonder if it even existed. One point of confusion for him, was that the southern end of the site where the Great Temenos was discovered seemed more Egyptian to him than Greek or Roman, causing him to speculate whether the Great Temenos was actually just an Egyptian fort.(6)</p>
<p align="justify">Between 1977 and 1983 two Americans, William Coulson and Albert Leonard Jr, returned to Naucratis for the first large scale excavation since Hogarth left the site in 1903. Their primary objectives was potter typology and attempts to make a stratigraphic sequence of the earlier excavations of the site. Excavations took place in the area of the Great Temenos and at a small mound east of the central part of the site, known as Kom Hadid.(3) Their 1980 survey of the mound came up with waste products of a kiln. Coulson and Leonard Jr felt that if these wasted form the remnant of the "slag heaps" seen by Petrie, then Kom Hadid represents an area of pottery making and would be important for understanding the industrial establishments of Ancient Naucratis.(6) Since much of the central excavated area of the site was now covered by a lake, Coulson and Leonard Jr deemed it impossible to recover anything from the northern part of the site. Instead they concentrated on the southern part, the Great Temenos, or as they called it the South Mound.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr/>
<p align="justify">The damaged shape of the site today continues to be a problem in further excavation of Naucratis. A lake now covers the old areas of excavation and the sebbakhin destroyed a majority of the amount of soil in the area over the course of many years, making precise stratigraphy impossible.</p>
<p align="justify">Historians find the research of this site important, as it gives insight into how the Greeks and the Hellenic world lived among and interacted with Ancient Egypt. Trade is an important research focus and we can see from the faience and pottery workshops that Naucratis was able to support itself by creating their own crafts and the discovery of Greek-style crafts among other Egyptian sites show where the people of Naucratis may have gone to trade.(2)</p>
<p align="justify">By looking at the research methods of the various archaeology teams over the years, we can see how our methods of discovery and research have changed. Many of the later archaeologists found it difficult to find Petrie's discoveries from his map and notes, causing much time spent in the later years attempting to verify his discoveries with all of the sebbakhin damage.</p>
