<p>Deir el-Ballas first came to light in January of 1900, under the supervision of George Reisner and his associates through the Hearst Expedition.</p>
<p>The site was built during the late Seventeenth Dynasty and used into the early Eighteenth Dynasty. The settlement was first ruled by Sekhenenre Ta’o II (1596-1591BC), and Ahmose (1570-1546BC) who ruled during the final period of occupation (Bunson 97). Archaeologists have found a larger variety of architecture here than in other traditional Egyptian domestic architecture. It’s architecture ranges from a double palace complex and its associated outbuildings to a workman’s village and its paved walkways.</p>
<p>Discussions as to what exactly this settlement was used for have turned up several possible scenarios. While the main thought is its use as a temporary location for Theban dynasts during the Hyksos expulsion, there are other valid theories floating around which include its use as a major administrative area, and also a military center.</p>
<p>It is likely that this settlement was used for a short period of time because of its small size and rather lengthy distance from the Nile. This site is not a prime location if looking for a long-term settlement plan as it’s location is random and construction hastily done. </p>

<p>Deir el-Ballas is located in northern Upper Egypt roughly 40 kilometers north of Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and is opposite the Nile from Koptos. The settlement is situated in a natural amphitheater formed of limestone cliffs bordering the High Desert to the west (Lacovara 62). The terrain consists of low gravel plain dissected by wadi beds (Bard 244). </p>
<p>Ballas consists of two palaces, a workman’s village and chapel, cemetery, grain silos, ovens, pens and mangers for animals, a textile production house, and an administrative complex.</p>

<p>The entire site is settled within a large enclosing wall. Within the walls is a plethora of diverse and interesting structural designs and layouts. Each of the unique structures were excavated and documented. The site can be divided into six main topographical areas. From north to south they include: North End, North Hill, North Wadi, Central Wadi, South Hill, and South Wadi (Bard 245).</p>
<p>At the northernmost end of the site, a group of small houses can be found surrounding one larger structure. Moving down to just north of the North Wadi, which is also the location just north of the North Palace, there is a long stream of houses that have now been reduced to shambles (Lacovara 11). Looking at the North Wadi, there is another group of badly eroded house structures. The houses near the North Palace suggest a textile workshop resulting in craft production (11). At the Central Wadi, there is evidence of heavy habitation—with approximately 15 house structures. As you move farther south you run into the South Palace and workman’s village (12). </p>

<p>There have been two major separate excavation projects in respect to this particular settlement with a multitude of other projects stemming off of the results from these excavations. </p>
<p>Excavations include the original Hearst Expedition supported by the University of California at Berkeley in 1900 headed by George Reisner and his two assistants F. W. Green and A. M. Lythgoe. The project started in January and lasted until May of that same year.  Unfortunately, Reisner and his team removed pieces of the North Palace tiered structures thinking they were later Coptic additions without recording them first—only to realize they were part of the original structure (Lacovara 62). This makes further excavation and understanding of this particular structure impossible. Without a picture or description of what the structure that was destroyed looked like, there isn’t anything current or future archaeologists can glean from these particular ruins. One can extrapolate data and interpretations from other similar structures from other sites built during this same time period, but nothing will be definitive.  Objects from the site were sent back to Berkeley and put on display just in time to be destroyed in the 1906 earthquake that shook the San Francisco area (63). A large amount of Reisner’s data is invaluable—especially those of the buildings that are either in ruins or are now absent. And at the same time there are several lavish houses and larger buildings that have little to no information catalogued about them—including sloppy notes and very few details. This has affected future excavations both positively and negatively. One positive is that this allows future archaeologists to uncover more of the site and add to the growing knowledge of Deir el-Ballas. Several of the structures originally uncovered by Reisner have eroded away due to exposure from excavation making them harder and sometimes impossible to analyze—even when using Reisner’s data and notes (Bard 245).</p>
<p>A second excavation, sponsored by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and headed by Peter Lacovara, ran from 1980-1986 and revealed extensive unrecorded aspects of the settlement. Lacovara began by conducting an initial survey and mapping, clearance and limited excavation (Lacovara 120). He picked up where Reisner left off and discovered that many of the structures Reisner discussed could no longer be identified—whether that is due to exposure or poor notes it will never be known. </p>

<p>The North Palace is the largest structure and appears to be the nucleus of the settlement and is surrounded by a large enclosure wall (Lacovara 121). It’s columned halls and rectilinear chambers were built on a casemate foundation that was filled with rubble and covered with a pavement of mudbrick. This was a place of residence for the royals. Faience tiles and ornate pieces of painted plaster are all that remain of this once magnificent multi-storied structure. A long corridor to the south showed walls decorated with wall paintings depicting armed men and weapons (121). Both actual and model weapons were found within its walls, as well as pottery dating back to the Eighteenth Dynasty. These paintings and weaponry adds to the evidence backing up the idea that this settlement was built as a military center.</p>
<p>The South Palace sits on top of a hill, allowing for 360-degree views of the Nile and surrounding areas. With a similar structure to the North Palace, this building had a columned court fronting and was built on a casemate foundation (121). Its main difference is its large staircase leading to the top of the platform. This platform holds the remains of what was once a building constructed of brick and matting, which was most likely used as an observation post.  This again would aid in the belief that this settlement was used for military purposes—a view like this would be immensely important and would allow for sufficient time to react to whatever is seen. </p>
<p>Several groups of houses can be found grouped together along the edge of the desert—all with irregular size and floor plan. Grain silos, pens, and mangers for animals are often found near these types of buildings (122). </p>
<p>The southern portion of the site contains the remnants of what appears to be a workman’s village and its associated chapels that have been cut into the hillside. These contiguous, roughly built structures were intertwined with paved streets. This area is also riddled with graves that contained scarabs dating from the reign of Amenhotep I to Thutmosis III and pottery of similar age. Further evidence that this single site was occupied by two separate populations at different times (124). </p>

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>There are several comparisons that can be made between Deir el-Ballas and Tell el-Amarna as both consisted of short-lived royal residences (Lacovara 124). The multi-storied North Palace at Deir el-Ballas is similar to the design of royal palaces of Amenhotep III at Malkata and Merneptan at Memphis in design, structure, and situation (124). Due to the general lack of information regarding the whole of the site, there is still a huge opportunity for future archaeologists to sink their teeth into this settlement. While Reisner brought this site to light through his early excavations, his sometimes sloppy technique and note taking has in some cases led us to ask more questions than we can answer. This site was occupied on two separate occasions. The first was for it’s original purpose, which was most likely the military center, and that was eventually abandoned shortly after the Hyksos were driven out of Egypt. The second occupation was during the Coptic period, where the new inhabitants built additions onto existing structures and buried their dead beneath the workman’s village (Locavara). </p>
