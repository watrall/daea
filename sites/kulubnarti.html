<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr/><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The excavation of Kulubnarti marks a significant change in how archaeological remains are studies during excavations. Before the construction of the Aswan High Dam, physical anthropologists ideas of racial determinism based solely on anatomical finds were accepted as scientifically accurate. The development of understanding that history is also continuing and not separate disconnected events created the greatest insight for cultural anthropologists during excavations. This realization also put an emphasis on excavating all artifacts, and not just human remains, for study <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981).

			</p>
<p>Real systematic excavations began in Kulubnarti in 1907 and many other excavations have taken place sense then. The work of the International Campaign to save the Monuments of Nubia, in response to the building of the Aswan High Dam, and the works of the University of Kentucky made great advancements on how artifacts are examined and helped give the first understanding of the transition from a Christian Nubian period to the Islamic Nubian period <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D.

<p>Kulubnarti is an island off the west bank of the Nile River 129 kilometers south of Wadi Halfa. The island itself is about one kilometer long and rises approximately 90 meters in a series of rocky promontories. The name Kulubnarti even literally means “island of Kulub.” Kulubnarti is a part of the Batn el-Hajar region of ancient Nubia, now modern day Sudan. Nubia is the area of the Nile Valley that extends from the first to the fourth cataract. This region is one of rocks and rapids and is known through antiquity for its gold and slaves <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981).

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Nubia was a solely Christian region from 550 to 1450 AD until it transitioned to Islam in the fifteenth century. The region today is politically divided between Egypt and Sudan, but during ancient times Nubia was the main passage through which cultural influences were transmitted between the Mediterranean basin and Black Africa. This caused Nubia to be very racially and culturally diverse with its mix of African and Mediterranean traditions. The Christian culture of Nubia disappeared during the mysterious time of the Dark Age between 1400 to 1813 AD. The first ethnographic accounts by modern travelers were also made at this time. A prominent archaeological feature on the island is an abandoned Mediaeval settlement that includes a very well preserved castle at the southern tip. Under Christian dominance, Kulubnarti was a relative peaceful place. A treaty with Egypt insured both peace and trade to the north, while a Christian king at Dongola promised political stability and security from the south. Unfortunately as time passed and Islam began encroaching, Kulubnarti became threatened. Increased Moslem military pressure from the north threatened Kulubnarti, while a takeover by a Moslem king at Dongola in the south caused the Batn el-Hajar region to become both isolated and politically fragmented. In reflection to the hard times, church construction saw a decline and defensive architecture prevailed. The Kulubnarti castle is a great example of the architectural change. The castle began as a single family house and over time it acquired an external ramp, a walled courtyard and a corner parapet and tower <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D.

			</p>
<p>An area of study at Kulubnarti is death rates. The probability of dying as an adult shows very little change from early to late Christian times. Children, on the other hand, had a great chance of dying between the ages of birth through fourteen if they lived in the earlier Christian days rather than the later <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D.

<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>

<p>Over 400 extremely well preserved burials were discovered in the modern Islamic village of Kulubnarti. The dry, arid conditions of the desert aided in keeping things preserved alongside the efficient burial customs of the Nubians. Burial shrouds made from old clothing, and occasional jewelry such as silver or iron crosses, still dressed the bodies and the natural process of desiccation preserved the hair, skin and even some internal organs. For this region, the age of those buried is unusual. Fetuses as young as seven months old were buried well. One grave even contained a mother and infant who both died during delivery. This practice will allow great opportunity to examine rarely studied mortality rates among the young members of the ancient Nubian society <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D.

			</p>
<p>The systematic investigation of Nubian history has been carried out almost entirely in the twentieth century because of the inundations resulting from the construction of new high dams. New dams like the Aswan High Dam at the first cataract caused extreme flooding in Lower Nubia. The First Archaeological Survey of Nubia in 1907 was done in attempt to save the rich antiquities in the flood areas. This survey was under the direction of George A. Reisner and his efforts were focused on salvaging both artifacts and human remains. Cultural anthropologists of this time were, unfortunately, given the task of diagnosing racial types based on the skulls found while excavating <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubia's last christians: The cemeteries of kulubnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of America." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>.
			</p>
<p>The Second Archaeological Survey of Nubia, in 1929 to 1934, witnessed a substantial de-emphasis of racial determinism, but the interest in racial characteristics of Nubians was still prominent. This approach of racial interest by physical anthropologists was not challenged until the construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1956 to 1966. At this time the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia began. This campaign involved thirty-six major archaeological expeditions over seven years and resulted in the excavation of over 1,000 important archeological sites. This campaign also shifted archaeological evidence away from an almost exclusive interest in graves towards a more comprehensive interest in settlements and their architectural and artifactual remains. And the new data that arose from these studies did not support any early interpretations of Nubian history because it was proving that history was not a distinct set of disconnected episodes. It was found that the lives and cultural characteristic of ancient Nubians revealed patterns of continuity and indigenous evolution since the Neolithic, and possibly Paleolithic times. These new discoveries prompted a reevaluation of earlier racial reconstructions that were only based on anatomical remains <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubia's last christians: The cemeteries of kulbnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of American." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>.
			</p>
<p>The University of Kentucky was drawn to Kulubnarti because of the emerging new way that the Nubians were being viewed and began extensive excavations there in 1969, focusing largely on the final Christian period of Nubia. The excavations of this time shed light on many aspects of the Late Mediaeval culture change that took place. Although none of the sites investigated on the island seemed to have been continually occupied from Mediaeval to modern times, but they did fit into a developmental sequence from 1100 AD to present that William Y. Adams created <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubia's last christians: The cemeteries of kulubnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of American." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>. 
			</p>
<p>It was not even known before 1969 that cemeteries existed at Kulubnarti. One cemetery on the island and one on the mainland were mapped and about thirty graves from each were opened, inspected and closed. This marked the first observation of the remarkable physical preservation of the Kulubnarti burials <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubias last christians: The cemeteries of kulubnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of America." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>.
			</p>
<p>The University of Kentucky returned to Kulubnarti in 1979, drawn by Christian Nubians. Between the months of January and April of 1979, 218 individuals were disinterred from the island cemetery and 188 from the mainland. Pottery found in the graves was also analyzed. Data from these finds indicated that the island cemetery was used during the Early Christian period (550-750 AD). These finds again did not coincide with Adams’ discovery, but then offered the opportunity to gain additional historical depth instead <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubia's last christians: The cemeteries of kulubnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of America." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>. 
			</p>
<p>While the mainland cemetery also contained earlier Christian burials, vaulted brick tombs were present as well. These tombs indicated the transition from Christian to Moslem  burial positions which means the cemetery was used all the way through the ending of the Christian period into the Islamic period <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Van Gerven, D. (1981). Nubia's last christians: The cemeteries of kulubnarti (3rd ed., Vol. 34, pp. 22-30). Archaeological Institute of America." href="#" rel="citation">(Van Gerven 1981)</a>.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The city of Kulubnarti is archaeologically significant because it was subjected to one of the only systematic excavations along the southern Nile. The main reason for excavations to be done at Kulubnarti came from wanting to increase the understanding of the cultural transition from Christianity to Islam during ancient times. Prior to the excavations there was no archaeological or historical evidence for the decline of Christianity, so thanks to the efforts of the University of Kentucky, greater knowledge has been developed on the ancient Nubian town.
