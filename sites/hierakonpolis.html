<p>Hierakonpolis is considered the most important archaeological site of the beginning of Ancient Egypt's history. This site was home to many of the early kings due to it being the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at the time. Hierakonpolis was first excavated in 1898 by J.E. Quibell and is most known for its limestone mace-head of King Scorpion and a ceremonial slate palette of King Narmer. There is a large cemetery nearby and many structures made out of mud brick and stone. Some other artifacts were found at the site, such as copper statues, but were added much later <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Encyclopedia Britannica. (2014, March 4). Hierakonpolis. In Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved November 20, 2014." href="#" rel="citation">(Encyclopedia Britannica, 1)</a>.</p>
<p>Excavation of Hierakonpolis began in 1898 by British Egyptologists James Quibell and Frederick Green, apprentices to the father of modern archaeology, Flinders Petrie. Their excavation at the site lasted for only two seasons, but was full of discovery. For these men, the 1898 season led to the discovery of the Main Deposit at the early temple and the 1899 season was focused on the excavation of the nearby cemeteries. The site wasn’t excavated again until 1967, when it was taken over by a team of Americans led by Walter Fairservis and Michael Hoffman. They excavated an area called Locality 6 in the early 1980s and made more astounding discoveries. This site was revisited in 1998 by a British archaeologist named Barbara Adams. There are ongoing excavations to unravel the mysteries at Hierakonpolis <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38).

<br/>
<p> Hierakonpolis, also referred to as Nekhen, is across the Nile from El-Kab and north of Aswan and Edfu. It is also located approximately 50 miles south of Luxor. This places the site in Upper (southern) Egypt where the connections to gold mines and trade routes through the Eastern Desert aided in its development. Two other areas, including Naqada and Thebes, competed with Hierakonpolis for power over the region <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 30)</a>. This site is located at an old and dry delta of a wadi fading into the Nile from the West Desert. Natural boreholes in the area allow for the analysis of the complex sediment sequence <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pawlikowski, M. (2009). Geology and geomorphology as reasons for location of archaeological sites. Egypt . In AGH. Retrieved November 20, 2014." href="#" rel="citation">(Pawlikowski, 1)</a>. The oldest exposed rocks at Hierakonpolis belong to the upper part of the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, which contains variegated shale and ferruginous sandstone which extends into the desert west of the present cultivation zone. At Hierakonpolis, the Sahaba silts cover an extensive area in which Predynastic sites bordering the modern flood plain are located <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Hamroush, H.

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>  Hierakonpolis is now known as Kom el-Ahmar, which translates to "red mound", due to a small pile of remains scattered with red pottery and burnt earth. The entire site, including the town and its surrounding cemeteries, covers an area of close to 40 acres. It seems that the site had a its temple and the pharaoh's residence near the floodplain, with cemeteries, rock carvings, and an earlier settlement extending into the desert to the west <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 30)</a>. There are so many well known parts of this archaeological site including the Fort, Rock Art, the Brewery, Nubian cemeteries, Dynastic tombs, and the pottery production house. The many excavations at Hierakonpolis have created a better understanding about how this space was used thousands of years ago. </p>
<img class="rounded h-auto rounded-2xl img-fluid mb-3 shadow-lg mb-8 w-full" src="http://www.hierakonpolis-online.org/images/assets/hkmap.jpg"/>
<p> <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 2. Hierakonpolis Map. Hierakonpolis Online." href="#" rel="citation"> Image 2.</a> A map of the entire site of Hierakonpolis. </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>  Referencing the map above, it is clear to see that much of the settlement occurred in the area surrounding the floodplain of the Nile. This map is not oriented in a perfect north and south relation to the edges of the picture. However there is a compass in the bottom left corner displaying the correct cardinal directions. There is also a legend in the bottom right corner of the map to interpret the color coded sites.  </p>
<p>  Looking at the top of the map, which is actually the most north-eastern part of Hierakonpolis, there is a large yellow square labelled "NEKHEN." As mentioned before, this is the part of the site that would have housed the early kings and pharaohs of Ancient Egypt. The two yellow circles that are labelled "outlier" near to the pharaoh's settlement likely were part of his compound used to house other elite members of society. </p>
<p>  Moving slightly south of the pharaoh's compound, there is a lot of yellow and blue shapes signifying many settlements and cemeteries. Referencing the legend, the yellow areas represent settlements and the blue areas represent cemeteries. This would have been the area where all of the commoners lived to support the pharaoh. Just as many other early settlements in Ancient Egypt, the commoners lived near, but separate, from the elite as part of a growing civilization. Beginning at the north-western part of the settlement and moving toward the south-eastern part (or left to right), important site names such as HK29 will be identified and explained. The first site is HK24, which is directly south of the pharoah's compound. This site was the main brewery at Hierakonpolis and still has existing structures that show its use. Directly south of that is a black rectangle labelled "FORT." Early on in Ancient Egypt's Predynastic times, there was a constant struggle for power and a large fort such as this was necessary for survival. Image 1 is a picture of this fort, which is the oldest freestanding mudbrick structure in the world. Moving to the south-west of the FORT, there is a site labelled HK29 which is the pottery production area sometimes called a burn house. There are many tombs scattered across the landscape, but none as famous as the "Painted Tomb" in the north-eastern corner of the main settlement. This was likely the tomb for an elite member of society, potentially the pharaoh himself <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Friends of Nekhen. (2014). Hierakonpolis Online.

<br/>
<br/>
<p>  The final part of the site is at the bottom of the map in the southern part of Hierakonpolis. HK11 was likely a ceremonial center for religious practices such as sacrafice. The blue circle titled HK6 to the south-west of HK11 is where animal remains including elephant bones were recovered. There is also a lot of rock art scattered along the southern part of Hierakonpolis, which can be seen as red dots <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Friends of Nekhen. (2014).

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p> British Egyptologists James Quibell and Frederick Green began the excavations in 1898 at a temple that was built in late 4000 B.C. Both Quibell and Green were apprentices to Flinders Petrie, the father of modern archaeology, but were not successful in implementing their education. Hierakonpolis was a difficult site to excavate and the poor techniques of these men has caused issues for the analysis of modern day archaeologists. Regardless of the poor initial excavation, many important artifacts were recovered that have been crucial in the understanding of Ancient Egypt and its formation into a powerful civilization <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 32)</a>. </p>
<p>  These men discovered a large number of votive objects near the early temple that they named the Main Deposit. Some of these objects have become the most important pieces in understanding the formation of the early Egyptian state. These objects include ceremonial cosmetic palettes, maceheads, and carved ivory figurines. Due to the wide range of age in these objects, it is hard to determine where they came from and when they arrived to Hierakonpolis. Three specific objects that are viewed as the most important are the Narmer Palette, the Narmer Macehead, and the Scorpion Macehead. Unfortunately, the Narmer Palette is the only intact artifact from the site, but it contains a high level of detailed information <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 32)</a>. The Narmer Palette can be seen below. </p>
<img class="rounded h-auto rounded-2xl img-fluid mb-3 shadow-lg mb-8 w-full" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5UpQIi6873w/UWsZMfYXHII/AAAAAAAABAg/LKJ4P-XzCCM/s1600/NarmPalette1.gif"/>
<p> <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 4. Narmer Palette. Your Guide to The Egyptian Museum." href="#" rel="citation"> Image 4.</a> </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> As seen in the image above, the Narmer Palette is a two sided piece that is carved in a dark grey siltstone. On one side (left image), there is a king, who is identified as Narmer, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt. He is smiting a prisoner in the presence of the Hawk god, Horus, who was the primary god worshipped at Hierakonpolis. On the other side (right image), Narmer is seen wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt and taking part in a procession toward a line of decapitated heads <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 33)</a>. The interpretation of this piece is that Narmer was already the king of Upper Egypt, where Hierakonpolis is located, and conquered Lower Egypt to create a unified state. There is spectulation that Narmer was the first pharaoh of the Ancient Egyptian state. </p>
<p> The Narmer Palette was not found in the Main Deposit, but it was found somewhere in the area. There is a chance that it was found in a storeroom nearby the main temple. Also found in these storerooms were a number of statues that were sculpted out of different media. There are two identical statues, one of of siltstone and the other out of limestone, that depict a second dynasty ruler by the name of Khasekhemwy. Nearby, there is a identical set of two copper figurines that were added much lader by Pepy I in the sixth dynasty. These findings are significant because they are the first three-dimensional representations of Egyptian royalty <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 33)</a>. </p>
<p>  In the 1899 season of excavation, Quibell and Green discovered the Painted Tomb. As mentioned before, this tomb belonged to an elite member of society, potentially the reigning king. There is much debate about the meaning of the wall paintings at Hierakonpolis, but many experts agree that they are religious drawings and faithful depictions of life along the Nile including hunting in the desert <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 34)</a>. These are the oldest known tomb paintings in Egypt and represent what was important and common for those living at that time. </p>
<p> From 1967 onward, an American team of archaeologists by the names of Walter Fairservis and Michael Hoffman took over the site of Hierakonpolis. In the early 1980s, Hoffman was the first to discover HK6 where he recovered eight elite burials and animal remains including dogs, baboons, and cattle. There were even some remains of fish, goats, and crocodiles! It was not until later in 1997 that British archaeologist Barbara Adams discovered the remains of elephant bones. This area has been identified as a mass burial ground for animal and human remains. It was likely used for ceremonial practices such as sacrifice to the gods <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Shaw, I. (2003). Exploring Ancient Egypt (pp. 29-38). New York, NY: Oxford University Press." href="#" rel="citation">(Shaw, 34-37)</a>. Finding remains such as these provides a window into the religious practices of the time and the significance that some animals played in relation to the gods Ancient Egyptians worshipped. </p>

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p> There are ongoing excavations of all of the sites mentioned at Hierakonpolis to further understand the meaning of the complex findings. For example, it is unknown why Ancient Egyptians went to such large efforts to bury an entire elephant, but archaeologists are continuing to work at explanations. Hierakonpolis is an extremely important site because it was a religious and political capital when Ancient Egypt was becoming a unified nation. There is potential that it was the first capital and home to the first pharoah. By understanding sites such as Nekhen, other sites that are from similar time periods or geographic regions are able to be understood on a deeper level. The relationship between the sites mentioned helps to piece together the story of Ancient Egypt and make sense of the related artifacts.   </p>
