<p> El Kab is an archaeological site in Upper Egypt that is also known as the ancient town of Nekheb. This town was named after the Ancient Egyptian Goddess Nekhbet, often depicted as a white vulture. The site was used as a religious temple for the worship of Nekhbet and a burial ground for many of the Ancient Egyptian royalty. It is most known for its exterior wall, the royal tombs, and the large mud brick structure that dominates most of the site. The site was first visited by European travellers in the 1740s, but was not excavated until the late 1890s by James Edward Quibell and Frederick William Green (Limme, 2). </p>
<p> Excavation of el Kab began in the late 19th and early 20th century by a team of  British Egyptologists. The team included James Edward Quibell and Frederick William Green, apprentices to the father of modern archaeology, Flinders Petrie. They were accompanied by Archibald Henry Sayce, Joseph John Tylor, and Somers Clarke. The excavation was taken over by a team from Belgium in 1937 led by Jean Capart and his successor Pierre Gilbert. They continued the excavations before and after World War II. These excavations have primarily taken place within the Great Wall of el Kab. The site continues to be excavated today and more discoveries are constantly made. The focus of recent excavations has shifted to the north and north-eastern side of the town of el Kab (Limme, 3). </p>

<p> El Kab is situated in southern Upper Egypt, on the eastern bank of the Nile River, across from Hierakonpolis. It is about 15 kilometers north of Edfu, and between Luxor and Aswan. Approximately 50 miles above Thebes, an important political center in Ancient Egypt, el Kab currently stands almost completely level with the Nile River. This is due to the Nile meandering and eroding the rocks that originally stood in between the town and the river. Just like the archaeological site of Hierakonpolis, el Kab has a very similar geological composition (Limme, 3). This site is located at an old and dry delta of a wadi fading into the Nile from the West Desert. Natural boreholes in the area allow for the analysis of the complex sediment sequence. The oldest exposed rocks at el Kab belong to the upper part of the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, which contains variegated shale and ferruginous sandstone which extends into the desert west of the present cultivation zone. At el Kab, the Sahaba silts cover an extensive area in which Predynastic sites bordering the modern flood plain are located (Hamroush, 161). </p>

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p> El Kab, formerly known as Eileithyiaspolis during Greco-Roman times, has been an important archaeological site throughout Ancient Egyptian history. The site takes up a large amount of space, beginning next to the Nile River and extending into the Eastern Desert. The site is most well known for its "Great Wall" that towers over the main settlement as a form of protection. Other important features include the rock-cut tombs that are nearby the main settlement, and the remains of many temples that are scattered through the landscape. The extensive and thorough excavations at el Kab have help to create a better understanding of how this site was used throughout Ancient Egyptian history. The massive mudbrick walls enclose an area of close to 25,000 square meters. (no idea) </p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>  Referencing the map above, it is clear to see that much of the settlement occurred in the area surrounding the floodplain of the Nile, with the main settlement directly on the edge of the river. There is a small image in the top left corner that displays where el Kab is in relation to the entire Nile River. This map is oriented in a perfect north and south relation to the edges of the picture and has a legend in the bottom left corner of the map. There is also a ruler located in the legend that explains the scale of the map in regards to distance between different parts of the site that are displayed.  </p>
<p>  Looking at the top left corner of the map, which is actually the most north-eastern part of el Kab, there is a large rectangle with the words "WADI HILAL" inside of it. The Wadi Hilal is a dried up valley that opens into this area. This part of the site was reserved for different temples, including the Temple of Amenhotep III which is near Vulture Rock. This temple is located at the spot that says "temple" in the top left corner of that rectangle. The two triangles are large rock formations, with the one in the bottom left being Vulture Rock. Moving slightly south and west of this rectangle, there is a shaded area between the numbers 57 and 60. This shaded area is supposed to represent an archaeological sight, as seen within the legend. The Chapel of Thoth is located at site 60, and the Ptolemaic Temple is located at site 57. These sites are extremely important temples that were the focus of many excavations.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p> Much of the archaeological findings have been discovered on the southern end of the site by the bank of the Nile. At the very top of the map there is a shaded region labelled "Rock Tombs of New Kingdom Nomarchs" which are cut into the side of a large rock feature. Immediately to the west of these rock-cut tombs, there is a small square that is labelled the "Temple of Tuthmosis III" which is dedicated to a pharoah in the 18th dynasty. To the south and east of this temple is an Old Kingdom Cemetery, which is a good representation of the use of el Kab throughout all of Ancient Egyptian History. </p>
<p>  The final part of the site is at the bottom of the map in the southern part of el Kab. There is a large outlined square that has its bottom left corner missing due to the edge of the Nile River. This thick line is the large exterior wall that surrounds the main settlement of el Kab. The wall is approximately 520 meters by 590 meters (Limme, 3). The wall was used as a way to protect those that lived inside of the settlement from foreign attackers and the rising waters during the flooding season. Within this gigantic wall, there are a few archaeological sites that have been excavated. In the lower left corner, there is a smaller square labelled " Temple of Thoth" and a Sacred Lake nearby. Similar to the Chapel of Thoth, this was a similar structure build to worship the god. It is in the temple complex near the Temple of Nekhbet, whom the town is named after. In the upper right corner of the large square, there is a shaded area that is labelled as "Part of Old Town." This was one of the earliest sites used at el Kab in the Early Predynastic. El Kab grew and evolved over time and had other structures built on its soil. </p>

<h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-6 text-2xl"> Excavations and Results </h3>
<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p> When travelling down the Nile River, it is almost impossible to miss the archaeological cite of el Kab. Its giant sun-baked brick walls are thirty-eight feet thick, surrounding an enclosure over 2000 feet long and about 1550 feet in width. The buildings once standing inside the enclosure have almost entirely disappeared (Breasted, 219). Much of the excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries performed by the team of British archaeologists was focused on the structures that were prevalent at the site. These included the Great Wall, the rock-cut tombs, and the assorted temples. No extraordinary artifacts were found at the site of el Kab, such as the Narmer Palette at Hierakonpolis, but many of the tombs and temples have associated art that tells the story of el Kab and Ancient Egypt over a long period of time. </p>
<p> One of the earliest parts of the site found was the Old Town Cemetery, that occurs just outside of the Great Wall. This cemetery was the first at el Kab and has the interesting feature of all of the bodies buried with their heads facing north and none of them are mummified (Quibell, 380). In the work of Somers Clarke, he states that many of the temples at the site have been changed over time, due to the continued used of el Kab. Many of the structures at el Kab have been eaten to powder by salt due to the poor quality of the stone and the remaining stones were stolen by ravagers for other uses (Clarke, 16). </p>
<p> When the Belgians took over in 1937, they have continued to excavate the site to this very day. They were able to discover objects that range greatly in origin of time period. These include jewelry from the Early Dynastic to gold coins from the Greco-Roman period. The largest finding by this team was done in recent years when they shifted the focus of their excavation to the north-eastern part of the site. There they found many different examples of petroglyphs, often left by the residents of el Kab over its entire life as a town. Within the rock-cut tombs at el Kab, they found a few decorated tombs, but most were largely destroyed over time (Clarke, 18). The rock art from el Kab can be viewed in the image below. </p>

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p> There are ongoing excavations of all of the sites mentioned at el Kab to further understand the meaning of the complex findings. As a site used throughout Ancient Egyptian history, it is important to understand why this town was so successful and others were not. By understanding sites such as el Kab, other sites that are from the surrounding geographic region are able to be understood on a deeper level. The relationship between the sites mentioned helps to piece together the story of Ancient Egypt and make sense of the related artifacts.   </p>
