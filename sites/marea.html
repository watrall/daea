<p>The city of Marea is an example of a rare harbor town on the shores of Lake Mariout. The site itself has remained essentially untouched, and remarkably preserved, since antiquity, making it a prime site for archaeologically excavations <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation">(Pichot 2012)</a>. The name Marea comes from the Latin derivative of the Greek “Mareotis” which is a topponym probably derived from the Egyptian root mrt, meaning canal, or mryt, meaning bank or shore. The city was first identified in 1872 by M. Pasha el-Falaki <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>. Marea is believed to have been founded even earlier than Alexandria, but the identification of the site is hypothetical at best. Even without proper identification, Marea was one of the most important towns of the region during its time. During the reign of pharaoh Psammeticus I (663-610 BC) Marea is believed to have been a station for garrisons and played a huge defensive role for the area <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. Classical sources say that General Amasis commanded the garrison in Marea during the 26th Dynasty. He was able to overthrow the central government of Egypt in 571 BC and declare himself pharaoh. Then in the following century, Marea became the capital of Mareotid <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>, and independent Libyco-Egyptian kingdom <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C.

(125 Bay State Rd., Boston 02215): African Studies Center, Boston University." href="#" rel="citation"> (Petruso 1982)</a>. The site has also been interpreted as a staging post for pilgrims en route for the monastery of Abu Mina 30 kilometers southwest of Marea <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a> during the early Christian era (4th-6th centuries AD) <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C.

(125 Bay State Rd., Boston 02215): African Studies Center, Boston University." href="#" rel="citation"> (Petruso 1982)</a>. This interpretation of Marea takes place during the Byzantine era and refers to the city as Philoxenite. Philoxenite is believed to have founded by Philoxenos specifically to serve as a welcome center for the traveling pilgrims. Before Alexandria, Marea was the major town in northwestern Egypt, acting as a strategic outpost against invasion from the west <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C.

(2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. Since Marea was such a commercially active and important town it is hard to understand why it declined, and there is no evidence as to why. One proposal is that Marea was deserted when Alexandria began slipping into decline after the Turkish conquest of 1517 AD <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1).

<p>Marea was a large agricultural community that greatly benefited from being a port town. Besides exporting agricultural goods, Marea also produced and exported glass, metal, and especially wines. During the Byzantine era, the city was most likely a market and redistribution center for wine, oil, papyrus, vegetables, fruit, grain, livestock, and fish. This claim is attested for archaeologically and historically. Exporting goods was fairly easy because the city had access to the Nile via canals and to the Mediterranean through the Alexandria cross-city canal. Being a port town was very important to Marea and was always a benefit, until the British came along. The British forces that were advancing on Napoleon’s army flooded the lake basin which then separated it from the Mediterranean except for a narrow limestone ridge. This separating caused the water levels to lower and expose the harbor facilities. Although bad for the city at the time, this exposure allows for easy examination and reconstruction for archaeologists. This is Marea’s greatest significance archaeologically <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563).

<p>Marea was first excavated in 1977 by a team led by F. El-Fakharani from Alexandria University. Their work concentrated on the port area of the town and last until 1981. This excavation produced many structures still very well preserved. El-Fakharani and his team found that the port is composed of a quay more than two kilometers long <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. The quay is divided into basins by three limestone jetties; two of which jut out 100 meters long and a shorter one only 40 meters long out into the lake. Portions of sea-walks were also found, sections of which have ramps into the water. A causeway runs parallel to a promontory on the eastern edge of the site that leads to a small offshore island. The island contains many structures and a pair of small piers, all of which have yet to be excavated. On top the middle jetty a four meter circle of curvilinear, fitted limestone blocks are interpreted to be a basin for a lighthouse of sorts. Between the quay and the short jetty to the west sits a pair of runners supported by limestone blocks. Each runner is about 20 meters long and extends into the former lakebed at a gradient of 1:16. These runners would allow a boat to be launched or hauled out of the water quite easily. These jetties and runners were held together by a reddish waterproof mortar <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>.
			</p>
<p>The team also did some work in town and found the quay to be bordered by a colonnade and row of shops. The walls of these structures still stand to a height of around one meter <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. The shops were divided into commercial and living spaces. Many staircases indicate possible two story buildings, or at least usable flat roofs. Feed bins and packed manure give evidence of livestock being held. Faunal remains suggest that pigs, sheep/goats, donkeys, and fish were the primary source of animal protein. Also amphorae show evidence of once holding oil. To the north a labyrinthine building foundation sits at the base of the promontory. The structure slopes down towards the river, but its function is yet to be determined. And out on the end of the promontory is another larger quay with a foundation of a basilica church, possibly 40 meters in length, resting nearby <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>. To the east of these buildings an oil or flour mill stands testimony to the agricultural activity of the once-fertile region <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content=" Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. Then to the west, vaulted double baths were discovered. Both symmetrical structures were covered with marble on the inside and had water heaters and multiple baths that could be collective or individual. The baths were divided into three sections: the cold bath, the warm bath, and the hot bath. And the buildings were separated by men and women. Everything about these baths indicates the wealth of the establishment <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>.
			</p>
<p>In 1979 Boston University held a summer field school for 75 American and Canadian students, at Marea, that joined El-Fakharani for the first of three consecutive field seasons <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C. (1982). Marea: A Byzantine port in Northern Egypt (5th ed., Vol. 36, pp. 62-63, 76-77). Boston, Mass. (125 Bay State Rd., Boston 02215): African Studies Center, Boston University." href="#" rel="citation"> (Petruso 1982)</a>. The students helped in mapping the lakeside portion of the site and conducted additional excavations until 1981 <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>. And then during the last two seasons, Thomas Boyd from the University of Texas joined El-Fakharani’s team as the staff architect. Boyd mapped most of the harbor and all of its associated structures <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C. (1982).

			</p>
<p>These findings date from the 5th century AD to the 7th century <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>, classifying them from the Byzantine age <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Petruso, K., &amp; Gabel, C.

Because of these potential capabilities, it is believed that Marea was intensively occupied during the Byzantine era <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>. There is no clear archaeological trace of pre-Byzantine Marea recorded, despite some intense beliefs. Some sources actually refer to an “earlier” and “later” Marea that are not necessarily in the same location <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>.
			</p>
<p>In addition, since July 2003 the Centre d’Etudes Alexandrines has been working on excavating the Marea peninsula situated some 100 meters northeast of Marea <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Pichot, V. (2012, August 1). CEAlex - Marea peninsula excavation - Introduction." href="#" rel="citation"> (Pichot 2012)</a>.
			</p>
<p>Artifacts found at this site suggest a fairly simple life for Marea’s inhabitants. Ceramics consist of cooking or serving wares and are dominated by coarse storage. Only occasionally are sherds of the local, thin Roman pottery found. Artifacts that are abundant are fragment of blown class, small copper or copper-alloy coins, loose tesserae, and remnant of poor quality frescoes are found, especially in the baths. Occasionally marble was imported, but only for flooring and linings of basins within the baths <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (1999). Marea. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (pp. 559-563). London: Routledge." href="#" rel="citation"> (Bard 1999)</a>.
			</p>
<p>Besides the occasionally graffiti on pots or building walls, no inscriptions have been found. And there is no evidence of the smelting or forging of metals, or of ceramic manufacture. So much of Marea remains unexcavated that it is possible that the industrial areas within or adjacent to the city could still be identified. Because of little dating available for the site, types of glassware and ceramics, including oil lamps and small holy-water flasks with the emblem of St. Menas impressed on them, architectural styles, construction techniques, and the occasional Christian graffiti, act as indicators of cultural and chronological order <a data-bs-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K.

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>Marea is a very rare and important site historically because of its function as a harbor city on Lake Mariout. Marea acted as a major port for the transport of goods and people to and from the town. The lowered water levels allowed for the limestone structures to stay really well preserved for thousands of years. This preservation has allowed for a more accurate understanding of what the site actually looked like in the past. Even though there are very few inscriptions or designators of the true name of the city, the evidence for the time period and function is accurate. Regardless of its true name, the excavations done at Marea have provided a greater understanding of how the people lived and how the society functioned thousands of years ago.
