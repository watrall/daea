		 	There are no temples or mortuary complexes associated with Kom el-Hisn except one from the New Kingdom dedicated to the local goddess Sekhmet-Hathor. Instead this site was a center of domestic life consisting of self sustained villages that functioned in time with, like the rest of Egypt, the ebb and flow of the Nile. While this site dates back to the Old Kingdom, a rarity for a city in the Delta, it developed over time and by the New Kingdom it was the capital of the third Nome. <sup>7</sup>

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>
		 	Kom el-Hisn is an archaeological site located in Lower Egypt in the Nile Delta region. It lies to the West of the city Tanta roughly halfway between Cairo and Alexandria. It is a primarily domestic site with the most significant portion of the structures dating back to the Old Kingdom. The site was characterized by a number of self sufficient rural towns and villages.<sup>2</sup>
		 	The area is more sand than fertile soil, so soil analysis only found easily grown remains of fodder crops, like clover, and the corresponding weeds were found. Evidence of farm animals was found in the soil as well. Primarily found was cow dung with minimal sheep and goat dung. However, in comparison to the amount of cow dung found there was considerably fewer cattle bones and cereal remains than expected.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
			The particular branch of the Nile Kom el-Hisn sat on has shifted Eastward in modern day times. It was the ebb and flow of that branch that the people living there organized their lives around. The site itself has remnants from the old town in the form of many low lying stone walls. These walls show different rooms and areas where cattle were held as seen in the picture.

<hr class="my-10 border-gray-100 my-10 border-gray-100"/>
<p>
		Petrie visited the site in 1884 though he seemed to have done no excavation.
		The first useful archaeological documentation came from F. Llewellyn Griffith who
		surveyed the site one year after Petrie visited it. He found various features on the site
		such as four columns, two of which were left standing.<sup>6</sup> They did not seem to have 
		a structural purpose but were religious in nature. They specifically depicted Rameses II 
		with who is presumed to be Hathor who is often represented as the cow goddess.<sup>7</sup>
		This is significant because later excavations reveal Kom el-Hisn to be a primarily cattle based
		society. He also found numerous religious statues and idols. Unfortunately much of what Griffith 
		found has since been badly weathered. The Cairo Museum holds a few of the artifacts described
		by him, however.
		</p>
<p>
		About 20 years later in 1903 Georges Daressy went through and wrote descriptions about 
		Kom el-Hisn. He not only wrote about the ancient peoples but what his current world’s
		interactions were with the site. It is a shame Kom el-Hisn was not more thoroughly excavated
		by either Petrie, Griffith, or another archaeologist because as he surveyed Kom el-Hisn he
		witnessed the rapid destruction of a mound by the company Delta Light Railways who was
		presumably leveling a part of the site to put a railroad track. <sup>7</sup>
</p>
<p>
		In the 1940’s Abdel Hamada, Mustafa el-Amir, and Shafik Farid excavated the site. 
		All original sources from this excavation are in either French or German, though small 
		references to discoveries such as where a grouping of settlements may be have been referenced
		in other archaeological papers.
		</p>
<p>
		In 1980 a team of Canadians surveyed the site. This survey was followed up a few years 
		later by a series of sample pits around the site that had more in depth analysis
		than any previous excavation. Especially notable were results from the soil sample analysis. 
		This analysis shed more light on the ancient people’s way of life. Traces of fodder crops,
		like clover, and the corresponding weeds that follow were found along with minimal cereal
		remnants. Evidence of farm animals was found in the soil as well. Primarily found was cow
		dung with minimal sheep and goat dung. However, in comparison to the amount of cow dung
		that was used on the soil, there was considerably fewer cattle bones and cereal remains than expected. <sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
		A look at the pottery remnants shows that there were beer jars and bread molds, 
		as is expected. An analysis of the ceramic clay found that the pottery fragments 
		uncovered at Kom el-Hisn were all from other regions of the Delta or further. 
		Next to no pottery in Kom el-Hisn originated from the site.
		</p>
<p>
		Another curiosity are the graves of Kom el-Hisn. Focusing on the cemeteries of 
		the area, Dr. Anthony Cagle does an in depth analysis of the origin of the corpses.
		All the cemeteries found at Kom el-Hisn date to just after the Old Kingdom with
		almost no cemeteries dating back to the time period that the site was originally inhabited. <sup>3</sup>
		Perhaps the people of the Old Kingdom had a burial site farther out from their living 
		space, but one has not been found.
		</p>
<p>
		Looking at the evidence of imported pottery from all over the Delta indicating a lack 
		of local craft production, the dependence on cattle, and other finds such as pieces 
		of carts, Kom el-Hisn has been concluded to be a stop along a major trade route to Libya. <sup>1</sup>
		The site was probably “a specialized government-sponsored, cattle-raising settlement or transport
		station.” This would explain, among other things, why there are less cattle bones than there is dung.

<p>
		Kom el-Hisn is a unique site in its rarity for the time period and
		its domestic nature, lacking major temples and tombs. It reflects a view of 
		Egyptian life that is not often dwelt upon, and in doing so forces the people
		who study the site to focus on the everyday citizen of ancient Egypt.
